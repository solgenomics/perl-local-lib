=head1 NAME

Hash::Case::Preserve - hash with enforced lower cased keys

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Hash::Case::Preserve
   is a Hash::Case
   is a Tie::StdHash

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Hash::Case::Preserve;
 tie my(%cphash), 'Hash::Case::Preserve';
 $cphash{StraNGeKeY} = 3;
 print keys %cphash;         # StraNGeKeY
 print $cphash{strangekey};  # 3
 print $cphash{STRANGEKEY};  # 3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hash::Case::Preserve extends L<Hash::Case|Hash::Case>, which lets you play
various trics with hash keys. This extension implements a fake
hash which is case-insentive. The keys are administered in the
casing as they were used: case-insensitive but case-preserving.

=item B<tie>(HASH, 'Hash::Case::Preserve', [VALUES,] OPTIONS)

Define HASH to be case insensitive, but case preserving.
The hash is initialized with the VALUES, specified as ref-array (passing
a list of key-value pairs) or ref-hash.

OPTIONS is a list of key/value pairs, which specify how the hash
must handle preservation.  Current options:

 -Option--Default
  keep    'LAST'

=over 2

=item keep => 'FIRST' | 'LAST'

Which casing is the preferred casing?  The FIRST appearance or the LAST.
Only stores will affect the casing, deletes will undo the definition.
Defaults to LAST, which is slightly faster.
